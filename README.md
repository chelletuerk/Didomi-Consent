# Water Bucket

## A small-scale application utilizing Create React App.  A User can enter two different 'bucket' amounts and the algorithm will calculate the intended measured amount.

## A brief run-down of the riddle:  

#### You have a 5 liter bucket and a 3 liter bucket and the task is to measure exactly 4 liters using only these two buckets.  You may fill and empty the buckets as necessary and have an endless amount of water.  How are you able to measure exactly 4 liters?

## The Answer:
* Fill the 5-liter bucket and empty 3 liters into the 3-liter bucket.  
* Empty the 3-liter bucket.  
* Pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter bucket into the 3-liter bucket.  
* Fill the 5-liter bucket a second time and pour the remaining 1-liter space in the 3-liter bucket.  
* This leaves 4 liters remaining in the 5-liter bucket.
